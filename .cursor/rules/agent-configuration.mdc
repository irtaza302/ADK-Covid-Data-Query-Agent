# ADK Agent Configuration Guidelines

This document outlines the structure and best practices for configuring the COVID-19 statistics agent using Google's Agent Development Kit.

## Agent Definition

The main agent should be defined in `lib/adk/agent.ts` following this pattern:

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'google.adk.agents';
import { getCovidStatistics } from './tools';

export const covidAgent = Agent({
  name: "covid_statistics_agent",
  model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
  description: "Agent to answer questions about COVID-19 statistics using BigQuery data",
  instruction: "You are an expert on COVID-19 statistics. Use BigQuery to provide accurate data when asked about cases, deaths, vaccinations, or other COVID-19 related metrics.",
  tools: [getCovidStatistics]
});
```

## Tools Implementation

Custom tools should be defined in `lib/adk/tools.ts` as TypeScript functions with proper typing:

```typescript
import { runBigQueryQuery } from '../bigquery/client';
import type { CovidQueryParams, CovidQueryResult } from '../types';

export async function getCovidStatistics(params: CovidQueryParams): Promise<CovidQueryResult> {
  // Implementation that queries BigQuery
}
```

## BigQuery Integration

The BigQuery client should be configured in `lib/bigquery/client.ts` with appropriate error handling and type safety.

COVID-19 specific queries should be defined in `lib/bigquery/covid-queries.ts` with parameterized queries for different statistics types.

## Session State

Use session state to remember user preferences and previous queries:

```typescript
// Example session state usage
export interface CovidSessionState {
  lastQueriedRegion?: string;
  lastQueriedStatistic?: string;
  preferredVisualization?: 'table' | 'chart';
}
```
